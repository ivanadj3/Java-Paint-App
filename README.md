# • Java Paint App (Spring GUI)

A simple Java-based paint application that allows users to draw geometric shapes such as points, lines, circles, donuts, and rectangles. Users can interact with the shapes via GUI dialogs and manipulate them using sort and stack operations.
This is one of my early Java projects focused on building a hands-on understanding of object-oriented design and GUI development. All shape behaviors (like drawing, moving, comparing, etc.) are abstracted through a flexible class hierarchy.

This project was created as a personal practice and learning project using Java and Swing.
